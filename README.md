# Raven
Stress test the hell outta your API with this simple CLI tool.

# Get it!

This is a Go program. If you already have Golang installed, installing `raven`
is as simple as:

```bash
$ go install github.com/clagraff/raven
$ raven version
raven 1.0.0
```

# Stress Testing
There are a couple ways to stress test an endpoint. You can:
* perform N concurrent requests _at once_
* ramp up the number of current requests until...
    * ... response times exceed percent threshold of average
    * ... number of non-200 responses exceeds a percent threshold

## `do`
>>> Immediately send N concurrent requests to the endpoint.

```bash
$ raven do 50 get http://localhost
Total Requests:      50
Elapsed Duration:    54.222567ms
Setup duration:      183.107Âµs

Average Request Duration:  23.841312ms
Min Request Duration:      4.562712ms
Max Request Duration:      53.17683ms

Total Response Size (bytes):    561
Average Response Size (bytes):  11

Status Codes:
	HTTP 200:	50
```

## `stress`
### Duration
>>> Ramp up concurrent requests sent until the respponse duration exceeds a defined threshold

```bash
$ raven stress duration get http://localhost:32768/
Step delay:                   500ns
Baseline response time:       4.306627ms
Percent threshold:            10.000000 percent
Max acceptable response time: 4.73729ms

Performing 1 concurrent requests...
Performing 2 concurrent requests...
9.971642ms exceeds 4.73729ms
```
